Link to Live-Working Version of Application (Not Final): https://nespresso-training-app.onrender.com
> Please refer to the [nespresso-training-app](https://github.com/kjeshang/nespresso-training-app) GitHub Repository to view the code of the Live-Working Version.

This repository is designed for viewing and documentation purposes.

The "5_DownloadImages" folder was used to create a fully local version of the training application but due to the number of image files used, I am unable to push to GitHub. Thus, the version of the application that is pushed to GitHub retrieves images from the internet.
